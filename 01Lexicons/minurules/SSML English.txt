Amadeus Mini Rules is a short summary of the most important restrictions and rules, such as:
Advanced purchase.
Minimum and maximum stay.
And exchanges and refunds.
These restrictions apply to a fare.
They are based on the rule restrictions and conditions of the full itinerary,
which is processed and validated at pricing time.
How to apply Mini Rules to a PNR.
Let's display the Mini Rules by entering FWR.
We can see from our display that the Mini Rules for the outbound sector are displayed.
The Mini Rules display the conditions associated to this fare, for example:
Revalidation, reissue, and no shows.
Let's move down.
We can see the rule information that applies after travel has started.
On this page, we can also see the rules for the return sector.
Let's move down again.
Here we see similar information as before.
However, this information can differ between the outbound and return sectors.
So, it's important to review the rule carefully.
How to display Mini Rules from a ticketed PNR.
Let's take a look at how to display Mini Rules from a ticketed PNR.
There are two options you can use to display Mini Rules from a ticketed PNR.
The first option is to display Mini Rules by FA line number.
Enter FWR/L and the FA line.
The second option is to display Mini Rules using the PNR electronic ticket number.
You don't need to retrieve a PNR to use the display option by ticket number.
How to display Mini Rules from an offer.
Let's take a look at how to display Mini Rules from an offer stored in a PNR.
In our example, we have a PNR that contains an offer.
To retrieve this offer, enter RTOF.
From the Offers display, we can now request a Mini Rules display.
Enter FWR and the offer number.
In this case, to display the Mini Rules for the second offer,
enter FWR/O2.
How to email an itinerary and include the Mini Rules.
An itinerary that includes the Mini Rules can be emailed to our passenger,
by adding /MNR to end of the email command.
When the email is displayed, we can see the information that applies to the itinerary.
We can also see the conditions associated to the fare.
Additional display options for Mini Rules.
We can also display Mini Rules using the following options:
From a stored TST (FWR/T2).
By passenger selection (FWR/P1).
By infant (FWR/INF).
And for all passengers except infants (FWR/PAX).
